Embarking on the 100-Day Flutter Challenge: A Journey of Growth and Learning
Hello everyone,

Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey as I embark on the 100-Day Flutter Challenge. This challenge is a commitment to spend the next 100 days focused on learning and developing with Flutter, Google’s UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. I’m thrilled to dive into this challenge and want to share my motivations, goals, and what you can expect from this blog series.
